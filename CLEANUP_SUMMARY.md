**COMPLETELY REMOVED** ✅

## Features Removed

The following features have been completely removed:

## Verification Steps

To verify everything is clean:

1. **Check Git**:
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show: "nothing added to commit but untracked files present"
   ```

2. **Check Database**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 gophish.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='risk_profiles'"
   # Should return: (empty)

   sqlite3 gophish.db "PRAGMA table_info(campaigns)" | grep dynamic
   # Should return: (empty)
   ```

3. **Check Files**:
   ```bash
   ls models/risk_profile.go
   # Should return: "No such file or directory"

   ls controllers/api/risk_profile.go
   # Should return: "No such file or directory"

   ls ai_module/
   # Should return: "No such file or directory"
   ```

4. **Check Application**:
   - Start Gophish: `./gophish.exe`
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3333
   - Create new campaign
   - Verify: NO "Use Dynamic Templates" checkbox appears
   - Verify: Templates page works normally without AI features

## Summary

✅ **Database cleaned**
✅ **File structure maintained** (as requested)
✅ **Application builds and runs**
✅ **No residual code from the features**

The application is now in its original state, ready for fresh development or use.
